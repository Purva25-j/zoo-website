                    Jijamata Udyaan, also known as the Byculla Zoo and formerly Victoria Gardens,
                    is a zoo and garden covering 50 acres located at Byculla, in the heart of Mumbai,
                    India. It is the oldest public garden in Mumbai.[3] After Indian independence,
                    it was named after Jijamata, the mother of Shivaji, the first Maratha emperor.
                    In 1835, British administration granted a large plot of land in Sewri to the Agro
                    Horticultural Society of Western India for a botanical garden known as Victoria
                    Gardens after Queen-Empress Victoria. That land was later acquired for a European
                    burial ground.[4] In 1861, construction of a new garden was commenced on 33 acres
                    in the Mount Estate, Mazgaon (now included in Byculla). The flora from Sewri garden
                    was transferred to this new garden named Jijamata Udyaan which was formally opened to
                    the public by Lady Frere on 19 November 1862. Agro Horticultural Society of Western
                    India continued to maintain Victoria Gardens until 1873 when the society's end led to
                    the municipal corporation taking over the garden's upkeep. In 1890 the garden was extended
                    by 15 acres especially for the zoo.[3]

                            <br>The predecessor of the zoological garden is the menagerie,
                            which has a long history from the ancient world to modern
                            times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed
                            during excavations at Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a c.â€‰
                            3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included hippopotami,
                            hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats.[9] King Ashur-bel
                            -kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire created zoological and
                            botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century
                            BCE, the Chinese Empress Tanki had a "house of deer" built, and
                            King Wen of Zhou kept a 1,500-acre (6.1 km2) zoo called Ling-Yu,
                            or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of
                            animals included King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah,
                            Queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and King Nebuchadnezzar
                            of Babylonia.[10] By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the
                            Greek city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals
                            that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman
                            emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in
                            the arena,[10] the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century
                            historian W. E. H. Lecky wrote of the Roman games, first held in 366 BCE.

                    </center>
                    <br>By 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo
                    animals.[citation needed] This trend, however was and still is somewhat
                    species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually
                    spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new
                    enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment.
                    For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures.
                    Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the International
                    Zoo Yearbook.[48] Animal exchanges between facilities are usually made voluntarily,
                    based on a model of cooperation for conservation. Loaned animals usually remain
                    the property of the original park, and any offspring yielded by loaned animals
                    are usually divided between the lending and holding institutions. For decades
                    the capture of wild animals or purchasing of animals has been broadly considered
                    unethical and has not been practiced by reputable zoos.
